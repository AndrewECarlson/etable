Package agg provides aggregation functions operating on IdxView indexed views
of etable.Table data, along with standard AggFunc functions that can be used
at any level of aggregation from etensor on up.

The main functions assume use of names to specify columns, but *Idx versions
are available that operate on column indexes.
